# PrimeScapeNC---Website
Website designed for local landscaping business.
I created a website for a local landscaping business using HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript.
The website is fully responsive, meaning it adjusts to fit any screen size, whether it's viewed
on a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone. The design is clean and modern, with a focus on showcasing the business's portfolio of landscaping projects.
The site features a home page with an overview of the business, an about us page with information about the team, a gallery page with photos of past projects, 
a services page with a list of services offered, and a contact page with a form for visitors to
request a quote or ask questions.
